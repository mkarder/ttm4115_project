# TTM4115 semester project

This is the project Repo for the semester project in TTM4115 - Design of Communicating Systems.

The systems displays a barebones Digital RAT System (DRS) for creating Readiness Assurances Tests (RATs) and for hosting RAT sessions.
The Server folder contains the necessary components and code for hosting a local server foir the DRS. The Teacher folder contains the necessary components and code for running the Teacher application for the system. For now, teachers are limited to create and publish RATs. The Student folder contains the necessary components and code for running the Student application for the system.
We refer to the system specification for the design plan for our system and explenation of the interactions of the different componnents of the system. This specification also includes future work that needs to be implemented for the system to be fully functional.

An overview over the relevant MQTT messages are provided as an Markdown file named "mqtt-overview".
